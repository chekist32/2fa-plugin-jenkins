    Enable two-factor authentication for users in specific groups, you can enter the group names separated by
    semicolons (e.g., group1;group2;group3). When a user logs into Jenkins and belongs to any of the groups listed,
    they will be prompted to re-authenticate using the 2FA plugin.

    For example, if you enter the groups admins;developers;users and a user who is a member of the user group logs
    in, they will be prompted to enter their 2FA code.</p>
