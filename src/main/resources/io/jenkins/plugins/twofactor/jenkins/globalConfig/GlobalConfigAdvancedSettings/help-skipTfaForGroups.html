    <p>Bypass two-factor authentication for users in specific groups, you can enter the group names separated by
        semicolons (e.g., group1;group2;group3). When a user logs into Jenkins and belongs to any of the groups listed,
        they will not be prompted to re-authenticate using the 2FA plugin.
        </p>
        For example, if you enter the groups admins;developers;qa and a user who is a member of the admins group logs
        in, they will not be prompted to enter their 2FA code.</p>
